# PotholeDetection_1
This code doesn't work fully, but it implements the list feature and the initial 3 fragment layouts and attempts to bring these features together.

Also android studio was being annoying and anytime I tried to do a direct upload to github it would revert back to its unedited version. Therefore, the folder structures are not that intuitive. I had to zip a bunch of the sub-folders so that I could upload this project faster for efficiency sake.
